A dumb little project. A Drawfee fan site.

This is a little side project written in Clojure.

It takes a youtube URL with a timestamp and creates an SVG outline of the frame.

I made this specifically to extract line art from the [Drawfee Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Drawfee) (they're great :) ), so that I could make a simple fan site cataloging some of their sketches.

This is all one big hack and shouldn't be taken as top quality code.

It also doesn't work perfectly yet. I have some polishing to do!
